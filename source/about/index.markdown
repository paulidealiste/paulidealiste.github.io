My name is Miloš Blagojević, and I currently work at the Department for Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Science, Kragujevac, Serbia as a teaching assistant. My research is focused on shape and size changes in complex morphological structures, mainly crania of two wonderful mammalian species, chamois (*Rupicapra rupicapra*) and roe deer (*Capreolus capreolus*).

This website was created using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) a framework for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator. This framework really eases the process of creating a basic website structure and lets the potential author concentrate on the content. It is mostly suited for a blog-like website, since the authoring of the posts is facilitated by using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), that is really a lightweight HTML, great for writing structured posts, with embedded multimedia, code blocks and comments.

All comments and suggestions are wellcome.
